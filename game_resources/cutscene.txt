Hiro faces off against the villain, a power-hungry Yakuza leader, Kuro. Kuro wants to usurp the control of Kabukicho, with no regard for peace or code of honor. Hiro has to navigate allegiances, old debts and friendships to get to the truth.",
  
  "act2": "Hiro attempts to restore peace, but encounters obstacles that make his journey more difficult. Kuro, seizing control, wreaks havoc: unjustifiably seizing territories, oppressing innocents, and causing infighting among the Yakuza clans. Hiro is tested by his own ethics, strength and friendships. Fighting Kuro’s foot soldiers, unearthing clandestine deals, Hiro slowly exposes Kuro’s treachery and sees the depth of his once vibrant world’s decay under Kuro’s rule.",
  
  "act3": "In the final act, with the clans in chaos and the on-the-brink of all out war, Hiro confronts Kuro for a final battle in the heart of Kabukicho district. Despite a brutal fight, Hiro, driven by his love for his city and honoring the code of the Yakuza, defeats Kuro. The Yakuza clans, witnessing Kuro’s downfall, rally with Hiro, returning peace and honor to the streets of Kabukicho. Having saved his world, Hiro vanishes into the shadows, ever the silent guardian of his city."
